# LESSONS

* Need to build things gradually instead of coding a ton of functionality and testing it at the end.
	- This happens because I have a vague idea of an implementation, but have not defined it concretely.
	- I would need to spend some time thinking about it.
	* POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Once the implementation has been described, coome up with steps/tasks that will gradually build the system.
