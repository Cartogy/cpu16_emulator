# LESSONS

* Need to build things gradually instead of coding a ton of functionality and testing it at the end.
	- This happens because I have a vague idea of an implementation, but have not defined it concretely.
	- I would need to spend some time thinking about it.
	* POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Once the implementation has been described, coome up with steps/tasks that will gradually build the system.

* When making tests, I am noticing how cumbersome the parameters are for each operator.
	- The current CMAKE project structure is not the best, but I plan to dissect it later on to better understand it.
* There are two important concepts when compiling:
	- Linking of binary libraries.
	- Inclusion of path directories in the project.
	- By understanding how to provide accessibility to the required libraries and paths, can I then implement a decent CMAKE project structure.
* All this will take times.
